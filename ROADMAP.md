### v1.1 - Goal Management + E2E Testing ‚è≥ IN REVIEW
**Status**: Submitted to Apple App Store (Oct 20, 2025)
**Estimated Approval**: Late October 2025
**Development Time**: 3 days
**Test Coverage**: Backend 77%, Frontend 55% (E2E tests)

#### Objectives
Fix critical bugs affecting user experience in production and establish comprehensive E2E testing infrastructure.

#### Backend Changes
1. **Test Endpoint for UI Testing** ‚úÖ
   - Added `/api/test/clear-user` endpoint to reset user data between tests
   - Protected by `ENABLE_TEST_ENDPOINTS` environment variable
   - Enables test isolation for onboarding flows

#### Frontend Changes

1. **Fix Goal Creation Refresh Issue** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Problem**: After creating a goal, it doesn't appear in GoalView until app restart
   - **Solution**: Fixed GoalStore refresh in OnboardingView after goal creation
   - **Files**: `OnboardingView.swift`, `GoalView.swift`

2. **Add Delete Goal Functionality** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Solution**: Added menu button on goal cards with delete action
   - **Implementation**:
     - Added contextual menu with delete option
     - Calls DELETE `/api/goals/{id}` endpoint
     - Refresh GoalStore after deletion
   - **Files**: `GoalView.swift`, `BackendAPIService.swift`
   - **UI**: Menu button (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢) ‚Üí Delete ‚Üí confirmation alert
   - **Localization**: Added delete strings (EN/FR/ES)

3. **Add Edit Goal Target Date** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Solution**: Added edit functionality via menu with date picker
   - **Implementation**:
     - Edit option in goal card menu
     - CollapsibleDatePicker component for date selection
     - Calls PUT `/api/goals/{id}` endpoint
     - Refresh GoalStore after update
   - **Files**: `GoalView.swift`, `BackendAPIService.swift`, `CollapsibleDatePicker.swift`
   - **UI**: Menu ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Date picker sheet ‚Üí Save/Cancel
   - **Localization**: Added edit strings (EN/FR/ES)

4. **Multi-Goal Support** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Users can now create and manage multiple active goals simultaneously
   - Goal list properly displays all active goals
   - First goal (closest deadline) is used for plan generation

#### E2E Testing Infrastructure (NEW)

**Test Suites**:
1. **AthloopUITests.swift** - 12 tests covering:
   - Tab navigation
   - Goal view elements and accessibility
   - Plan view elements
   - Health tab basics
   - Performance testing

2. **OnboardingUITests.swift** - 6 tests covering:
   - Complete 4-step onboarding flow
   - Goal suggestions and custom input
   - Back navigation
   - HealthKit toggle

**Coverage Tracking**:
- **Backend**: 77% coverage via Python `coverage` tool
- **Frontend**: 55% coverage via Xcode code coverage
- Unified `run_e2e_tests.sh` script runs both with full coverage reporting

**Test Isolation**:
- Tests use fixed device ID (`UI-TEST-ONBOARDING-DEVICE`)
- Automatic data cleanup via `/api/test/clear-user` endpoint
- Each test starts with clean state

**Accessibility**:
- All UI elements use accessibility identifiers (language-independent)
- Tests are stable across translations

**Documentation**:
- `README_E2E.md` - Quick start guide
- `E2E_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `XCODE_COVERAGE_SETUP.md` - Xcode coverage configuration

#### Testing Results
- ‚ö†Ô∏è E2E infrastructure complete, tests need environment variable fixes
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Goal appears immediately after creation
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Users can delete goals via menu
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Users can modify target dates via menu
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: Multi-goal support working correctly
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: All features tested in light/dark mode
- ‚úÖ Manual testing: All features tested in EN/FR/ES languages
- üìä Backend coverage: 77% (via E2E test run)

#### Known Remaining Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CoreGraphics NaN warnings (no user-facing impact)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AutoLayout constraint warnings (cosmetic)
